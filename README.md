## Solution for Gilded Rose Kata

### Description

**Original Kata:** [Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata][1]

This solution doesn't introduce new tests, trusting only in the _Golden Master_ already provided by the original kata. (yeap, I know this is dangerous)

The premise is that sometimes the code is so dirty that introducing new tests will take so much effort that will be a waste of time.
Watch [Practical Refactoring][2] for more details.

### Running the tests

Follow [these instructions][3] to install TextTest.

**Important:** do not forget to change [config.gr][4] to match the path of your cloned repository.
